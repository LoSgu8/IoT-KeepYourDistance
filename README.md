# KeepYourDistance
## Politecnico di Milano - Internet of Things 2020/21 - Final Project
The purpose of this project was to simulate a set of motes that periodically send a message (500ms). If
a mote receives 10 consecutive messages from the same mote, it would trigger an alarm through a push
notification to the smartphone. 
For the realization of this project, TinyOS (tested in Cooja Simulator), Node-RED and IFTT were used.
